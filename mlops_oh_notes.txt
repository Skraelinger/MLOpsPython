azureml-logs/20_image_build_log.txt

conda_dependencies file requires deprecated azure meta-package
https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/10646

replaced with:
- azure-mgmt-compute
- azure-mgmt-storage
- azure-mgmt-resource
- azure-keyvault-secrets
- azure-storage-blob (already included)

Build still includes "azure" meta-package even after it was swapped out from all .yml files.

Trying modification to safedriver-variables-template:
  # Flag to allow rebuilding the AML Environment after it was built for the first time. This enables dependency updates from conda_dependencies.yaml.
   - name: AML_REBUILD_ENVIRONMENT
    value: "true"

Deleted train_cluster and reran DevOps pipeline.  Run 9_10.  This time "azure" package is gone and it seems we got past the env setup stage of the Train Model step.
Cancelled the run after waiting 20+ minutes.  Log indicates success with one error in the middle:
91mERROR: azureml-sdk 1.0.74 has requirement azureml-dataprep[fuse]<1.2.0a,>=1.1.29a, but you'll have azureml-dataprep 1.4.3 which is incompatible.

Reran pipeline. Run 12_13....
